It allows alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and hyphens (`-`). This satisfies the character length and hyphen inclusion requirement.\n* `[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}`: Matches a single alphanumeric character to ensure that the string ends with an alphanumeric character.\n* `$`: Matches the end of the string.\n\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* **Matching Strings:**\n    * `abc123`\n    * `a-bc-123`\n    * `A123`\n    * `123ABC`\n    * `test1-test2`\n* **Non-matching Strings:**\n    * `-abc123` (starts with hyphen)\n    * `abc123-` (ends with hyphen)\n    * `123abc` (too short)\n    * `abc12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789` (too long)\n\n\n**Python Code Demonstration:**\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nregex = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}[a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{1,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}$"\n\ntest_strings = ["abc123", "-abc123", "a-bc-123", "123abc", "123-abc", "abc12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789"]\n\nfor test_string in test_strings:\n    if re.match(regex, test_string):\n        print(f"\'{test_string}\' - Matched!")\n    else:\n        print(f"\'{test_string}\' - Did not match!")\n\n```\n\nThis code will test the given strings against the regex pattern.
